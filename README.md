## An Example of Parsing Email with Processing

An example of using the [JavaMail](https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home) package to parse email in Processing. Also includes a simple wrapper class that avoids the jankiness of the JavaMail API (and demonstrates how to use that API). To extend yourself, checkout the [JavaMail API Docs](https://javamail.java.net/nonav/docs/api/).

The example emails used here are from the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).
